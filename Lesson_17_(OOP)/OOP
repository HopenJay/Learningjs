Object oriented programming is another style of programming.

How do we use it:
This is basically organizing our code into objects

Why do we use OOP:
OOP tries to represent the real world.
Easy to create multiple objectss

Example using cart:
In a real world a cart is a physical object, in oop we represent the physical obj in a digital way.

In simplicity because of oop representing the real world in a digital way, it makes the code more intuitive and easier to understand.

Another reason why we use OOP is that it's easy to create multiple objects.

Note: In object oriented programming the naming convention is to use PascalCase. In PascalCase you start every word with a capital letter.
